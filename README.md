greenlight project for BSV Hackathon June 23 - Aug 18  2020

To demo greenlight, it has to be hosted on my laptop because greenlight is too complex to create an installer for it at this time given that a BSV FullNode is required.

However, I do intend to move the hosting up to Google App Engine in the cloud very soon.
